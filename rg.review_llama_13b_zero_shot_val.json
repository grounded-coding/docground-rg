Is there any other information we should know before going to Maharajah Tandoori? Answer: Yes and no - It depends on what you want. If you come here just for food, you won't regret it but the service sucks bad so bring cash because you will have to pay for everything including water while waiting and everything being mediocre at best. So people complain more often than usual due to this and management isn't willing to help.

This is very tricky because of `context-free grammar`.\n\nWhenever the conversation stops, just look at both parts of it - if they're the same length and have equal numbers of words: both parts as a single string - then you know it's a valid response from the user.  There are many other ways this could fail though. For example, say the answer is \"yes\" but user asks another question right away (\"are there good restaurants near here?\"), your program will miscount the \"words\".  Finally, notice you cannot control when a user pauses in between words. That means if we do word counting we may count one word too much (or not enough). To combat that issue I introduced several checks involving the time the chat ends; these can detect such cases.  We also look at the past history of the input stream, which can help even more against things like bad", "id": 13}, {"target": true, "response": "Efes restaurant has 5-star rating on yelp for their great food and ambiance.
